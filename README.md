Drink Water

This is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a "Drink Water" web page. It displays a virtual cup with a goal of drinking 2 liters of water. You can select how many glasses of water you have drunk by clicking on small cups below the big cup. The percentage of the goal completed is updated in real-time as you drink more water.

The HTML code contains the structure of the webpage. It has a header with the title "Drink Water," a div element to hold a cup with the amount of water you've drank, and another div element with glasses that you can click to update the amount of water you've consumed. The HTML also links to a CSS file and a JavaScript file.

The CSS code styles the HTML elements on the page. It sets the background color of the body to blue, the font to Montserrat, and centers the elements. It also creates a cup with a border and fill color, and styles the small cups that the user can click on.

The JavaScript code is responsible for the functionality of the application. It updates the amount of water the user has consumed as they click on the small cups, and it displays the amount of water consumed in the big cup. When the user fills up the big cup, the application stops recording the amount of water consumed.
